# LibCal API

I wrote two little scripts to experiment with [LibCal's](https://www.springshare.com/libcal/) equipment booking APIs:

* [equipment_bookings.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/python_scripts/equipment_bookings.py) is a python script that outputs a json file, an HTML file, and a csv file listing LibCal equipment bookings in your system for the current date
* [departments.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/python_scripts/departments.py) is a python script that outputs an HTML table listing the total number of LibCal equipment bookings in your system by department for the current date
* [libcal_equipment.gs](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/google_apps_scripts/libcal_equipment.gs) is a Google Apps Script that writes LibCal equipment bookings in your system for the current date to a Google Spreadsheet

Cool!
