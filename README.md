# LibCal API

I wrote two little scripts to experiment with [LibCal's](https://www.springshare.com/libcal/) equipment booking APIs:

* [equipment_bookings.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/equipment_bookings.py) outputs a json file, an HTML file, and a csv file listing equipment bookings in your system for the current date
* [departments.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/departments.py) outputs an HTML table listing the total number of equipment bookings in your system by department for the current date

Cool!
