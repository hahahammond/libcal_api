# LibCal API

I wrote two little scripts to test...

* [equipment_bookings.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/equipment_bookings.py) outputs an HTML table listing equipment bookings in your system for the current date
* [departments.py](https://github.com/hahahammond/libcal_api/blob/master/departments.py) outputs an HTML table listing the total number of equipment bookings in your system by department for the current date
